## Overview
This guide covers everything you need to know to get started building add-ons for the [Adobe Express Public Beta](https://www.adobeprerelease.com/beta/06B4980B-3CE7-4E4C-F126-F622E6D91103). At a high level, add-ons refer to any feature distributed independently from the core product that a user can enable or install to extend the capabilities of the core product. Typically, add-ons will be created by 3rd party developers, however, there will also be scenarios where Adobe will be creating and distributing our own add-ons. These docs are available to provide you with all of the information you need to get set up and well on your way to developing your own add-ons for Adobe Express. Please see the [main help guides](https://helpx.adobe.com/express/using/express-overview.html) for more information and frequently asked questions about Adobe Express.

## Extensibility

The new Adobe Express Public Beta release enables a new add-ons feature which extends Express to provide maximum flexibility for using Web technologies to create and share assets. These add-ons are  self-contained and available in a new add-ons panel to enhance the end user's projects. Some examples of features which an add-on may contain include:

- Importing images and video
- Exporting renditions of images in different formats
- Connecting to external sources via OAuth 2.0
- Storing and retrieving data
- Dragging and dropping of content
- Retrieving manifest data
- Managing language and locale
- Retrieving the current theme and detecting theme changes
