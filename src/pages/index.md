## Overview
This guide covers everything you need to know to get started building add-ons for the [Adobe Express Private Beta](https://www.adobeprerelease.com/beta/06B4980B-3CE7-4E4C-F126-F622E6D91103). At a high level, add-ons refer to any feature distributed independently from the core product that a user can enable or install to extend the capabilities of the core product. Typically, add-ons will be created by 3rd party developers, however, there will also be scenarios where Adobe will be creating and distributing our own add-ons. Some examples of add-on use cases include; importing media from another source via OAuth 2.0, persisting data (like preferences) to client storage, drag and drop capabilities, and many more. This guide will provide you with all of the information you need to get set up and well on your way to developing your own add-on for Adobe Express. Please see our [main help guides](https://helpx.adobe.com/express/using/express-overview.html) for more information and frequently asked questions about Adobe Express.

## Extensibility

For this early release, we have enabled developers to incorporate add-ons into the Adobe Express Private Beta, providing maximum flexibility for using Web technologies to create and share assets. Primary use cases are self-contained add-ons that enhance a user's projects. Some examples:

- Import images and video
- Connect to external sources via OAuth 2.0
- Store and retrieve data
- Support drag-and-drop of content to the canvas
- Retrieve manifest data
- Manage language and locale
- Retrieve the current theme and detect theme changes
- Export renditions of images in different formats
