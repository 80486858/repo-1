These docs are for Adobe Express add-on APIs which are still in private beta. [Join the waitlist](https://airtable.com/shr3IK38z2MCNHJEm).

# Overview
Adobe Express is an all-in-one content creation app that makes it fast, easy and fun to design standout flyers, TikToks, resumes, Reels, banners, logos, invitations, webpages and so much more. 
Add-ons are a new feature allowing 3rd party developers to extend the core functionality of Adobe Express, with a dedicated marketplace for them to be distributed for others to discover and enjoy.

## Add-on Developer Journey

1. Create an add-on project with the CLI. See the [Getting Started](../getting_started/) guides to help you create your first project quickly. 
2. Use the [Add-on Recipes](../guides/develop/) to code all of the features you want to build into your add-on. 
3. [Design your UI](../guides/design/) with the help of [Adobe's Spectrum Design System](../guides/design/#spectrum-design-system). 
4. [Debug](../guides/debug/) and test your add-on with your favorite browser tools, [Visual Studio Code](../guides/debug/vs-code.md) and the add-on logging window provided in the Express UI development environment.
5. [Distribute your add-on](../guides/distribute/) for public or private sharing.
