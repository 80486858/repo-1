# Add-on Developer Journey

1. Create an add-on project with our CLI. See the [Getting Started](../getting_started/) guides to help you create your first project quickly. 
2. Use the [Add-on SDK APIs](../guides/develop/) to code all of the features you want to build into your add-on. 
3. [Design your UI](../guides/design/) with the help of Adobe's [Spectrum Design System](../guides/design/spectrum.md). 
4. Debug and test your add-on with your favorite [browser tools](../guides/debug/), [Visual Studio Code](../guides/debug/vs-code.md) and the add-on logging window provided in the Express UI development environment.
5. [Distribute your add-on](../guides/distribute/) to the public. Submit your add-on for review and once approved, it will automatically be added to the available add-ons in Adobe Express.

**NOTE:** You can also choose to [distribute as a private link](../guides/distribute/submit-private-dist.md) first if needed.
