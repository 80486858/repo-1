Preview Adobe Express add-on SDK documentation while you wait to [join our private beta](https://adobe.com/go/express-developer).

<br/><br/>

# Overview
Adobe Express is an all-in-one content creation app that makes it fast, easy and fun to design standout flyers, TikToks, resumes, Reels, banners, logos, invitations, webpages and so much more. 

Add-ons are a new feature allowing 3rd party developers to extend the core functionality of Adobe Express, with a dedicated marketplace for them to be distributed for others to discover and enjoy.

## Add-on Use Cases
Some examples of add-on use cases include:

- Importing images and video
- Connecting to external sources via OAuth 2.0
- Storing and retrieving data
- Supporting drag-and-drop of content to the canvas
- Retrieving manifest data
- Managing language and locale
- Retrieving the current theme and detecting theme changes
- Exporting renditions of images in different formats

See the [code recipes page](../develop/) and [code samples](../develop/) for more details on how to implement the above use cases. 


## Add-on Developer Journey
An overview of the steps involved in creating an add-on are listed below along with their associated documentation links:

1. Create an add-on project with the CLI. See the [Getting Started](../getting_started/) guides to help you create your first project quickly. 
2. [Design your UI](../guides/design/) with the help of [Adobe's Spectrum Design System](../guides/design/#spectrum-design-system). 
3. Use the [add-on recipes](../guides/develop/), [code samples](../samples.md) and [references](../references/) to learn how to include all of the features you want to showcase in your add-on. 
4. [Debug](../guides/debug/) and test your add-on with your favorite browser tools, [Visual Studio Code](../guides/debug/vs-code.md) and the add-on logging window provided in the Express UI development environment.
5. [Distribute your add-on](../guides/distribute/) for public or private sharing. 

If you run into any issues at any time throughout your development process, please refer to the [Debug Guides](../guides/debug/) and [FAQ](../guides/faq.md) for more help.
