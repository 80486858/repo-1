# Introduction to Adobe Express Add-ons
Here you will find everything you need to know to get started building add-ons for Adobe Express. At a high level, add-ons refer to any feature distributed independently from the core Adobe Express that a user can enable or install to extend the functionality. Adobe will be providing built-in add-ons out of the box, but 3rd party developers will also have the opportunity to create and distribute their own add-ons by following the steps provided in this documentation.

## Add-on Use Cases
Some examples of add-on use cases include:

- Importing images and video
- Connecting to external sources via OAuth 2.0
- Storing and retrieving data
- Supporting drag-and-drop of content to the canvas
- Retrieving manifest data
- Managing language and locale
- Retrieving the current theme and detecting theme changes
- Exporting renditions of images in different formats
