# Getting Started Overview
This section provides everything you need to know to get started building add-ons for Adobe Express. 

## Introduction
At a high level, add-ons refer to any feature distributed independently from the core Adobe Express that a user can enable or install to extend the functionality. Adobe provides some built-in add-ons out of the box, but 3rd party developers also have the opportunity to create and distribute their own add-ons by following the steps provided in this documentation.
<!-- 
## Planning your add-on

### Choosing your idea

The best way to get attention on the marketplace is to create an add-on thatâ€™s useful, exciting and original.

Before you start, do a little research to see what other developers are doing, and where you can make an impact. Ask yourself the following questions while you're considering the add-on you want to build.

#### Useful

Does my add-on help users to do their work quicker and more effectively?

Does it help their process make more sense?

#### Exciting

Does my add-on enable users to be more creative, or make their work look better?

#### Original

Are there lots of add-ons already doing the same thing on the marketplace?

#### Use of AI

Does your add-on leverage AI to generate content or automate workflows? If so, be sure to check out the [Generative AI requirements](./genai/). -->
