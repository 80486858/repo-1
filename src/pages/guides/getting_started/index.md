# Getting Started Overview
Here you will find everything you need to know to get started building add-ons for Adobe Express. At a high level, add-ons refer to any feature distributed independently from the core Adobe Express that a user can enable or install to extend the functionality. Adobe will be providing built-in add-ons out of the box, but 3rd party developers will also have the opportunity to create and distribute their own add-ons by following the steps provided in this documentation.

### Getting Started Steps
The [Quickstart](quickstart) steps you will follow to get started building your first add-on include:

1. [Set up](quickstart/#prerequisites) your local environment.
1. [Create a new add-on project](quickstart/#step-1-create-your-add-on-project).
1. Log in to [the beta version of Adobe Express](https://new.express.adobe.com/new).
1. Enable the [developer mode](quickstart/#step-3-load-and-run-your-add-on).
1. [Load and run your add-on](quickstart/#step-3-load-and-run-your-add-on) directly in Adobe Express!
