# Core Content Actions

Core Content Actions are interactive elements that allow users to search, sort, and filter content within your add-on. 


## Actions Overview

These actions enable users to "drill into" specific sections, for example dynamically refining a list of thumbnails that follows.

## Best Practices

Core Content Actions, when available, should be arranged at the top of the add-on's content area. This ensures that users can easily access them and that they are always visible even when the grid below scrolls.

## Examples

TODO: Ask Matthew for examples that he mentions, and in general, more content for this page.
