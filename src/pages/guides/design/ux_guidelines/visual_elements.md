# Visual Elements

Adobe Express implements the "Spectrum for Adobe Express theme", which has been designed specifically for it. Youâ€™ll notice a friendlier visual tone, with bolder typography, softer rounding on elements, and indigo serving as the accent color.

## Color

## Typography

Spectrum is based on the Adobe Clean and Adobe Clean Han typefaces. The former is used for Latin characters, while the latter is for Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ones.
