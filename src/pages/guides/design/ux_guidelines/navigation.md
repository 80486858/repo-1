# Navigation

Navigation is a key component of any user interface. It helps users understand where they are, where they can go, and how to get there. Spectrum provides a few components that we recommend to help you build a clear and consistent navigation system for your add-on.

## Tabs

Tabs organize content into multiple sections and allow users to navigate between them; the content under the set of tabs should be related and form a coherent unit. Please always include a label for accessibility.
