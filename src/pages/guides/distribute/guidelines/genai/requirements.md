## Listing requirements

Your add-on's listing must be clear that generative AI is being used. This means you:

- must clearly communicate in the listing that generative AI is being used to create output
- must not try to mislead users by presenting generated content as content created by humans
- must accurately indicate if your add-on uses generative AI technology during submission—this ensures that users see additional information on the add-on's listing page about your use of generative AI.

## Content generation requirements

Content created by your add-on must adhere to [Adobe’s General Terms of Use](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html) and the [Developer Terms of Use](http://www.adobe.com/go/developer-terms).

Your add-on must not generate illegal content, including child and adult sexual abuse material. As a developer, you will be required to attest that you are following industry best practices and standards to ensure that your add-on can't generate illegal content. If your add-on is found to be generating illegal content, your add-on may be removed.

## Disclaimer requirements

If your add-on generates text or code, your add-on must remind the user that the content generated may be inaccurate. Users should always review the generated content with trusted sources before publishing the content or executing any code.  Because every use of AI is different, Adobe doesn't provide a one-size-fits-all example, but there are several examples in the generative AI ecosystem that should provide good examples.

## Use cases that don't require certification

Add-ons that meet the following criteria do not require the developer to submit a self-certification of compliance with our content generation requirements:

- Your add-on is privately listed (**NOTE:** We may still elect to remove your privately listed add-on if we receive credible reports of abuse)
- AI Models that the user installs and runs locally on their device (that is, models that are not included within the add-on bundle)
- Text-to-speech using Generative AI (provided the text is supplied by the user)
- Instrumental music or sound effects created using Generative AI (where there are no lyrics)
