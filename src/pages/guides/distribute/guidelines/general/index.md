# Overview

This section provides a set of guides to help you in the distribution stage of your add-on. 

## Introduction
The general guidelines that can be found in this section cover a variety of areas including [acceptable content](./content.md), [user interface guidelines](./user_interface.md), [listing metadata](./listing.md), [feature functionality](./features.md) and testing guidelines (e.g., [compatibility](./compatibility.md), [usability](./usability.md), [accessibility](./accessibility.md),[performance](./performance.md)) and more. 

## Testing
Testing is an important part of the add-on creation process. It ensures that the add-on is free from bugs, works as intended, and performs as smoothly as possible.

We strongly recommend that you test your add-on rigorously before submitting it for review, to avoid rejection or delays in submission

## Choosing your idea

Before you start, do a little research on the marketplace to see what other developers are doing, and where you can make an impact.

For example:

- Does my add-on help users to do their work quicker and more effectively?

- Does it streamline the userâ€™s workflow(s)?

- Does my add-on enable users to be more creative, or make their work look better?

- Are there lots of add-ons already doing the same thing on the marketplace?

## Use of AI

Does your add-on leverage AI to generate content or automate workflows? If so, be sure to check out the [Generative AI guidelines](../genai/). -->
