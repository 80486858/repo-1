This action makes the `task` binary available to Workflows.

## Inputs

### `version`

The version of [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/) to install.
Can be an exact version (e.g., `3.4.2`) or a version range (e.g., `3.x`).

**Default**: `3.x`

### `repo-token`

(**Optional**) GitHub access token used for GitHub API requests.
Heavy usage of the action can result in workflow run failures caused by rate limiting. GitHub provides a more generous allowance for Authenticated API requests.

It will be convenient to use [`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow).

## Usage

To get the latest stable version of Task just add this step:

```yaml
- name: Install Taskfile
  uses: arduino/setup-taskfile@main
```

If you want to pin a major or minor version you can use the `.x` wildcard:

```yaml
- name: Install Taskfile
  uses: arduino/setup-taskfile@main
  with:
    version: '2.x'
```

To pin the exact version:

```yaml
- name: Install Taskfile
  uses: arduino/setup-taskfile@main
  with:
    version: '2.6.1'
```

## Release

To release a new version of the Action the workflow should be the following:

1. `npm install` to install the dependencies.
1. `npm run test` to see everything works as expected.
1. `npm run build` to build the Action under the `./lib` folder.
1. `npm run pack` to package for distribution
1. `git add src dist` to check in the code that matters.
1. open a PR and request a review.
