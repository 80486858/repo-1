 Terraform Cloud/Enterprise encrypted variables via `resource.vaulted-tfe_variable`

# vaulted-tfe Provider

A terraform provider that utilizes https://github.com/sumup-oss/vaulted to provide
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform for https://app.terraform.io/ (Terraform Cloud/Enterprise) encrypted variables via
`resource.vaulted-tfe_variable` that:

* are **never** stored as plaintext in your terraform state.
* are **never** logged in stdout as plaintext.
* can be **safely** stored in SCM such as Git in their encrypted payload format produced by https://github.com/sumup-oss/vaulted .

Tested and used with "public" Terraform Cloud.

## Why should I use this?

At SumUp we're adopting Terraform Cloud with multiple workspaces as our
preferred terraform executor and remote state manager.

We're already using https://github.com/sumup-oss/terraform-provider-vaulted/
to allow **everyone** inside the organization to provision secrets,
store them in SCM and CI to provision them.

This enables us to completely shift-left in terms of responsibilities.

However, while moving to Terraform Cloud, we've noticed that we were
lacking a way to provision the Terraform Cloud workspace variables and
store them in SCM.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

The following apply here as well.

https://github.com/sumup-oss/vaulted#prerequisites

### Simple integration approach

1. Generate RSA keypair by following https://github.com/sumup-oss/vaulted#setup
1. Specify `provider` by following [Example Usage](#example-usage)
1. Add `vaulted-tfe_variable` resources
1. `terraform plan`
1. `terraform apply`
1. :tada:

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "vaulted-tfe" {
  # Preferably set via `TFE_TOKEN` environment variable
  # token = ""
  # Generate using `github.com/sumup-oss/vaulted`
  private_key_path = "./vaultedtfe.key"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **token** (String) The token used to authenticate with Terraform Cloud/Enterprise.

### Optional

- **hostname** (String) The Terraform Enterprise hostname to connect to. Defaults to app.terraform.io.
- **private_key_content** (String) Content of private key used to decrypt `vaulted-tfe_variable` resources. This setting has higher priority than `private_key_path`.
- **private_key_path** (String) Path to private key used to decrypt `vaulted-tfe_variable` resources. This setting has lower priority than `private_key_content`.
- **protocol** (String) Protocol to use when connecting to specified `hostname` Terraform Enterprise. Defaults to https
- **ssl_skip_verify** (Boolean) Whether or not to skip certificate verifications.
