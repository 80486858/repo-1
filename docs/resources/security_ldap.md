  auth_realm                     = "EXAMPLE"
  auth_schema                    = ""
  auth_username                  = "admin"
  connection_retry_delay_seconds = 1
  connection_timeout_seconds     = 1
  group_base_dn                  = "ou=Group"
  group_id_attribute             = "cn"

* `connection_retry_delay_seconds` - (Required) How long to wait before retrying
* `connection_timeout_seconds` - (Required) How long to wait before timeout
* `group_type` - (Required) Defines a type of groups used: static (a group contains a list of users) or dynamic (a user contains a list of groups). Required if ldapGroupsAsRoles is true.
* `host` - (Required) LDAP server connection hostname
* `max_incident_count` - (Required) How many retry attempts
* `name` - (Required) LDAP server name
* `port` - (Required) LDAP server connection port to use
* `protocol` - (Required) LDAP server connection Protocol to use
* `search_base` - (Required) LDAP location to be added to the connection URL

* `auth_realm` - (Optional) The SASL realm to bind to. Required if authScheme is CRAM_MD5 or DIGEST_MD5
* `group_base_dn` - (Optional) The relative DN where group objects are found (e.g. ou=Group). This value will have the Search base DN value appended to form the full Group search base DN.
* `group_id_attribute` - (Optional) This field specifies the attribute of the Object class that defines the Group ID. Required if groupType is static
* `group_member_attribute` - (Optional) LDAP attribute containing the usernames for the group. Required if groupType is static
* `group_member_format` - (Optional) The format of user ID stored in the group member attribute. Required if groupType is static
* `group_object_class` - (Optional) LDAP class for group objects. Required if groupType is static
* `group_subtree` - (Optional) Are groups located in structures below the group base DN
* `ldap_groups_as_roles` - (Optional) Denotes whether LDAP assigned roles are used as Nexus Repository Manager roles
* `use_trust_store` - (Optional) Whether to use certificates stored in Nexus Repository Manager's truststore
* `user_base_dn` - (Optional) The relative DN where user objects are found (e.g. ou=people). This value will have the Search base DN value appended to form the full User search base DN.

* `user_id_attribute` - (Optional) This is used to find a user given its user ID
* `user_ldap_filter` - (Optional) LDAP search filter to limit user search
